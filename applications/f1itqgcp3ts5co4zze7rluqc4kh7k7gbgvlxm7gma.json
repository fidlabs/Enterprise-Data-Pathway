Building on the foundation of web3.storage and Saturn, we founded Storacha as a community-driven hot storage network. \n\nWe've focused on creating a system that not only enhances storage and retrieval performance but also maintains the core principles of data verifiability and user ownership. Our platform has enterprise-grade capabilities, successfully managing petabyte-scale data operations. \n\nStoracha serves as a critical scaling layer for organizations looking to leverage the benefits of decentralized storage without compromising on performance or reliability.",
